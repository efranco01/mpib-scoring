 @header PGSQLConnection
 @abstract		A Connection class that is the root of all data access in 
				PGSQLKit.  Contextually, the PGSQLConnection encapsulates a 
				PQconnectdb() call and the results of that call.
 
 @discussion	The PGSQLConnection class provides the gateway to all of the 
				functionality in the library.  The only class that is not 
				reached through the Connection class is the Login class, which 
				is a utility class intended to provide an easy and reusable 
				tool for obtaining a Connection class without reinventing the
				login panel in every application.
 
				The core functionality of this class wraps around the libpq 
				interface.

 @class
 @abstract		PGSQLConnection is the core class in the Kit.  Using the 
				PGSQLConnection to create and use a database connection to 
				execute queries and return results from the database, everything
				else in the kit stems from this core class.
 @discussion	The usual use of this class is to create a connection that is 
				used for the duration of the connection.  A single connection 
				can support multiple queries, however, because of local storage
				of the results, it is possible that memory could become a 
				concern if mulitple result sets are open as the same time.

    @discussion During init, the PGSQLConnection clears and defaults all of the 
				properties in order to prevent unexpected values in any of the 
				parameters.  Though this is not normally a concern, there are a 
				couple of defaults to be aware of:
 
				host - defaults to "localhost"
				port - defaults to 5432
				dbName - defaults to "template1"
				
				If the defaultConnection is not already assigned from a prior 
				connection, then the defaultConnection is also set to be the 
				current connection upon init.
